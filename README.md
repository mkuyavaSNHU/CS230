Students will develop a deeper understanding of operating platforms and architectures through the analysis and evaluation of the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each. Students will learn the value of utilizing software design templates as well as how to utilize them to solve problems.

•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, The Gaming Room wanted to take their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which was only available on Android and develop a web-based game that is available on multiple platforms. 

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Ensured the document was clear and simple while providing the client with all critical information in a way that could be easily understood. 

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It helped me think through the project and understand and plan for obstacles and constraints that I might encounter during the code development. The Domain Model/UML Diagram was also a nice guide to reference when building the classes. 

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think that with more experience I would have a better understanding of might need to be revised within the document I created; however, I currently don’t feel any changes are needed. 

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Making the game user friendly with dependable security if important to users. Have the user’s needs as a top priority is important to ensure they want to start or continue to use the product. 

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Planning the project with UML diagrams and thinking through what obstacles I might encounter prior to starting the code development.
